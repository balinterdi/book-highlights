Jerry Weinberg maintains that most clients will tell you their most
serious problem, and its solution, in the first five minutes you talk
with them. It's vital to listen to what the client has to say, instead
of letting your attention wander to the cool solution you're dying to
try. You can brainstorm solutions later, but first, be aware of what is.
