A little reflection will show that it is these good's scarcity - the fact that
there can be conflict over these goods by multiple human actors. The very
possibility of conflict over a resource renders it scarce, giving rise to the
need of ethical rules to govern its use. Thus, the fundamental social and
ethical function of property rights is to prevent interpersonal conflict over
scarce resources.
