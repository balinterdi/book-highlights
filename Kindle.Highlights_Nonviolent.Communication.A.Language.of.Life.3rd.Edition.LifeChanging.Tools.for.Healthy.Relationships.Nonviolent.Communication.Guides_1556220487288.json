If we could just say, “Here are the needs of both sides. Here are the resources. What can be done to meet these needs?,” conflicts would be easily resolved. But instead, our thinking is focused on dehumanizing one another with labels and judgments until even the simplest of conflicts becomes very difficult to solve.","isNoteOnly":false,"location":{"url":"kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014OISVU4&location=3074","value":3074},"note":null},{"text":"When they say “no,” they’re saying they have a need that keeps them from saying “yes” to what we are asking.
