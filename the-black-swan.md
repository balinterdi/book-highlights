I noticed that very intelligent and informed persons where at no
advantage over cabdrivers in their predictions, but there was a crucial
difference. Cabdrivers did not believe that they understood as much as
learned people - really, there were not the experts and they knew it.
Nobody knew anything, but elite thinkers thought that they knew more
than the rest because they were elite thinkers, and if you're member of
the elite, you automatically know more than the nonelite.

Many people confuse the statement "almost all terrorists" are Moslems with
"almost all Moslems are terrorists". Assume that the first statement is true,
that 99 percent of terrorists are Moslems. This would mean that only about 0.001
percent of Moslems are terrorists, since there are more than one billion Moslems
and only, say, ten thousand terrorists, one in a hundred thousand. So the
logical mistake makes you (unconsciously) overestimate the odds of a randomly
drawn individual Moslem person (between the age of, say, fifteen and fifty)
being a terrorist by close to fifty thousand times!
