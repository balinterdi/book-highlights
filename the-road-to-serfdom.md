----
If the "community" or the state are prior to the individual, if they have ends
of their own independent of and superior to those of the individuals,
only those individuals who work for the same ends can be regarded as
members of the community. It is a necessary consequence of this view
that a person is respected only as a member of the group, that is, only
if and in so far as he works for the recognised common ends, and that
he derives his whole dignity only from this membership and not merely
from being man. Indeed, the very concepts of humanity and therefore of
any form of internationalism are entirely products of the individualist
view of man, and there can be no place for them in a collectivist system
of thought.
